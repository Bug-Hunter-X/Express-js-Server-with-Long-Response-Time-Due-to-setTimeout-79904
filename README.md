# Node.js Express.js Server with Long Response Time

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js Express.js applications: slow response times due to long-running asynchronous operations.  The example shows a simple server that introduces a 5-second delay before sending a response.  This can lead to problems with timeouts and poor user experience.

## Issue:
The provided code has a 5-second delay in sending a response. This isn't always a problem, but in cases where you need fast responses or have many concurrent requests, it can significantly impact performance.

## Solution:
The solution involves handling asynchronous operations more efficiently or using techniques like promises or async/await to improve response time and increase efficiency.
